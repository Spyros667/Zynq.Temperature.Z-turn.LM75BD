# Zynq.Temperature.Z-turn.LM75BD

Interfacing the LM75BD [temperature sensor] on a Zynq board with the name "Z-turn".

# Preliminary

## Temperature sensor

The temperature sensor, on board, is **LM75B** ([NXP link](https://www.nxp.com/part/LM75BD)):

![LM75B](img/LM75B.jpg)

It's an 11-bit ADC (with increments of **0.125**Â°C)

The 7-bit [I2C] address (taken from the previous picture) is **0x49**.

It is connected to **I2C0**, which is connected to **PL** pins P15 & P16. The provided **contraints** file has been set up.

For those new to [Zynq][Zynq], some pins are accessed through the [PS][PS] part while others through the [PL][PL]. (Pins of the former, have names like [MIO51][MIO]. This is what makes [Zynq][Zynq] special, splitting the workload between the [hard processor][PS] and the [programmable logic][PL]).

# I2C

Even though it's possible to handle I2C entirely in the PL (excluding the PS), we'll stick with using the PS's native, **embedded I2C** controller.

Accordingly, the library that'll be used is the [I2C-PS](https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18841822/I2C-PS+standalone+driver), with the respective [API](https://xilinx.github.io/embeddedsw.github.io/iicps/doc/html/api/index.html).
