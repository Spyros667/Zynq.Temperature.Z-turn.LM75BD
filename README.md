# Zynq.Temperature.Z-turn.LM75BD

Interfacing the LM75BD [temperature sensor] on a Zynq board with the name "Z-turn".

# Preliminary

## Temperature sensor

The temperature sensor, on board, is **LM75B** ([NXP link](https://www.nxp.com/part/LM75BD)):

![LM75B](img/LM75B.jpg)

It's an 11-bit ADC (with increments of **0.125**Â°C)

The 7-bit [I2C] address (taken from the previous picture) is **0x49**.

It is connected to **I2C0**, which is connected to **PL** pins P15 & P16. The provided **contraints** file has been set up.

For those new to [Zynq][Zynq], some pins are accessed through the [PS][PS] part while others through the [PL][PL]. (The former have names like [MIO51][MIO]. This is what makes [Zynq][Zynq] special, splitting the workload between the [hard processor][PS] and the [programmable logic][PL]).

[PL]: ## "Programmable Logic"
[PS]: ## "Processing System"
[MIO]: ## "Multiplexed I/O"
